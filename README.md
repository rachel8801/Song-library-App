# Song-library-App
The goal of the project is to build a simple graphical user interface for a song library that contains a list of songs. The GUI implements three functions: Add, Delete, Edit.
The song list file was stored in text format, and must be titled "songs.txt" If the file does not exist, it will create a new file.
